//Problem:
//Write a program that prompts the user to enter the year, month, the day of the month and displays  day
//of the week (Monday,Thuesday.....)

//The formula:
//Day = ((day of month) + (26*(month + 1))/10 + y + y/4 + c/4 + 5*c) % 7        y: year, c:century
//Hint: January and February are counted as 13 and 14 in the formula, so you need to convert the user 
//input 1 to 13 and 2 to 14 for the month and change the year to the previous year.

//Add Scanner
